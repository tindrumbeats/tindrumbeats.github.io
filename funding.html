                  <div class='row'>
                   <div class='col-md-6'>
                     <h3> Importance of this movie</h3>
                     <p>Every year thousands of films are made, so why is this movie important? 
While it’s very important to highlight a problem that is virtually unknown to people, what is more important is to tell a good story.</p>
                     <p>And that’s exactly what we believe we have: A truly original story about runaway children. We believe that the story has the potential to garner greater international exposure.</p>
                   </div>
                   <div class='col-md-6'>  

                      <h3> Why are we fundraising?</h3>
                      <p>Like every film ever made, we would like to be backed by producers who take interest in original and hard hitting stories. But as unfortunate as it sounds, it is not unusual that there are not many who are even ready to back a story that is not “commercial” enough.</p>
                     <p>If we didn’t believe in the story, we would have moved on. But we truly do and we believe that the story could create some waves in the international arena.</p>
                   </div>
                 </div>

                   <div class='col-md-6'>
                      <h3> What is our target?</h3> 
                      <p> We intend to raise <b> 48 lakhs </b> through crowdfunding. However, the budget is kept  flexible, as we might seek foreign funds for later stages of production and post-production.</p>
                     
                      <h3> How much we achived till date</h3> 
                      <p>  <a  href='backers.html' > <b> Rs 35,02,000  Raised from 61 backers </b> </a> </p>
                      <p> <a  href='backers.html' > <img src='chart.png' /> </a> </p>
 
                   </div>

                   <div class='col-md-6'>
                      <h3> What happens if we don't achieve our target through crowd-funding?</h3>

							 <p> While we're confident that eventually, we'll achieve our target, there are many possibilities to fulfill the gap.</p>
							 <p> 1) We intend to shoot 30 minutes of the footage for the movie with the initial funds we receive. Once we have 30 minutes of footage, we have plenty of opportunities within both India and abroad to acquire the rest of the funds. Some of this includes Doha Film Fund, Switzerland Film Fund, Hubert Bals Post Production Fund etc.</p>
							  <p> 2) We approach Film Markets and Film Bazars to raise the rest of the funds. Some of these are NFDC Work-in-progress meets, IFFI Goa Film Market etc.</p>
							  <p> 3) In the last scenario, we re-adjust the budget to suit our possibilities.</p>
							  <p> However, given the response we're getting from some of the producers from countries such as Norway and Denmark, we're pretty confident that we'll achieve our requirement.</p>

                       <p> Raju meets the gang-member Jollu – of same age - a boy addicted to solution, who teaches Raju about the tricks and trades of platform living. Raju slowly gets used to the platform life and is emboldened in his approach towards life. One day after a fight with a competing gang member the two lose their daily collection of water bottles. Jollu reveals that his real name is Afzal and narrates how he ran away from the Madrassah twice escaping the abuse by the Maulana. <br /><a href="synopsis.html" class="btn btn-primary"> <strong>Read More</strong>  </a></p>

                      <h3> Why also use the crowdfunding websites?</h3>
                      <p>With the sole intention to make payment easy for the contributor. Many payment  gateways have declined giving their services to us, as we’re not a service or a product oriented company. Hence to avail the gateway advantage, we’re launching our project on a crowdfunding site also. However, our primary point of focus will remain our website. For NRIs, our paypal payment gateway is still the best option.  And for resident Indians who wish to contribute through wire transfer and checks, we’ve provided details for both here on our website. And we appreciate check contributions from resident Indians, as this does not cut into your contributions in the form of gate-way commissions. </p>                   </div>

                     <h3> Current status</h3>
                     <p>The movie is currently is in pre-production stage. </p>
                     <p> Lead actors are finalised through auditions. Workshop is in progress for them. </p>

                      <h3> Road Map</h3>
                      <p>Pre-production: All the artistes will be cast after thorough auditioning. We will take help from the Department of Women and Children Welfare to look for the children to be cast from their Government Homes. Most of the children on Government Homes are runaway children or orphans.</p>
                      <p>We have the support of the NGO SATHI (www.sathi-india.org) and we’re hoping to rope in the support of other NGOs also. </p>
                      <p>Once the actors are cast, they’ll rehearse at a workshop for a few weeks.</p>
                      <p>The entire film will be shot in and around Yashwantpur Railway station. And production starts immediately after the completion of pre-production with a solid team in place.</p>
                      <p>Rest of the crew is not finalized yet. But rest assured, they’ll be the best we can afford.</p>

                   <div class='col-md-6'>
                      <h3> Experimenting</h3>
                      <p>Art without experiment is not art.</p>
                      <p>It is very important that you understand our approach for this movie. </p>
                      <p>As the story is rooted in realism, the approach is also realism. The whole movie will have a documentary style of filming and minimalistic approach with regards to everything else.</p>
                      <p>Since most of the child artistes we take are going to be new to this whole experience and are likely to be semi-literate, we’ll not burden them with dialogs and directions. Instead, we’ll give the children enough freedom and space to understand their characters and bring out the best in them with their own lines and expressions.</p>                 </div>

                    <h3> What are the risks involved? </h3>
                    <p>Film-making is laden with risks. But the rewards for the risks can always be great. We’re making the film on a very small budget. And we’re basing it on strong and original content. In recent times, small budgeted original films with original voices have made big impact both at international festival arena and at theatrical release. So, we’re confident that Railway Children will receive the same kind of support from both the sources.</p>
                    <p>There are many international film funds, film markets and Indian co-production markets that are always on the lookout for original films from committed filmmakers. These funds are eager to provide for those films which are starved of funds. </p>
                    <p>So, we’ll approach international co-productions that are available and explore other venues such as NFDC film bazaar. </p>
