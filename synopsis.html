                  <div class='row'>
                   <div class='col-md-12'>
                       <p> Raju, a 12-year-old run-away, steps out to an unknown, never-seen-before world on the railway platform. He is timid, insecure and unsure. The boy falls into the hands of a gang involved in illegal platform businesses. </p>
                       <p> Raju meets the gang-member Jollu – of same age - a boy addicted to solution, who teaches Raju about the tricks and trades of platform living. Raju slowly gets used to the platform life and is emboldened in his approach towards life. One day after a fight with a competing gang member the two lose their daily collection of water bottles. Jollu reveals that his real name is Afzal and narrates how he ran away from the Madrassah twice escaping the abuse by the Maulana.</p>
                    
                       <p> Having lost their daily collection, Raju and Jollu are severely punished by the gang-leader. When Jollu takes the punishment lightly, the gang-leader takes Jollu inside his scrap-shop and rapes the young boy. </p>
                    

                       <p> After an attempt by Jollu to drink alcohol for the first time fails, he jabs himself repeatedly with a nail and hurt himself badly. Raju gets a taste of the base harshness of the platform living.</p>
                    

                       <p> As the days progress, the two are obsessed at being taken as men and not boys. From shaving his non-existent moustache to inserting a foam phallus inside his pants, Raju makes all attempts to be passed as a man.</p>
                     
                       <p> From Raju’s telephonic conversations with a friend named Usha, it becomes clear that he wants to bring her here. When Jollu asks about Usha, Raju proclaims proudly that Usha is his girl-friend.</p>
                    
                       <p> They realize that while platforms are divided among gangs for selling spurious drinking water, the trains themselves are free for anyone. Both Raju and Jollu reconcile with another platform-boy and start selling water on their own.</p>
                    
                       <p> However, the gang-leader comes to know about this. They beat up Raju and Jollu and take away all their money. </p>
                    
                       <p> When the gang-leader tries to sexually assault them again, Raju and Jollu put up a fierce fight. The Railway police intervene and detain them. </p>
                    
                       <p> What seems like an abrupt end, is only the beginning of a different struggle at a different place. Will the most dreaded place turn them into prisoners and make them live their nightmares? Is Raju who he claims to be or does he carry a secret? Will Jollu cope with his addiction and phobia for his home?...form the rest of the story. </p>
